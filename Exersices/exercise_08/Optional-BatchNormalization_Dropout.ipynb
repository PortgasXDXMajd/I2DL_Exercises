Batch Normalization\n","\n","## 1.1 What is Batch Normalization\n","One way to make deep networks easier to train is to use more sophisticated optimization procedures such as SGD+momentum, RMSProp, or Adam. Another strategy is to change the architecture of the network to make it easier to train. One idea along these lines is batch normalization which was proposed by [1].\n","\n","The idea is relatively straightforward. Machine learning methods tend to work better when their input data consists of uncorrelated features with zero mean and unit variance. When training a neural network, we can preprocess the data before feeding it to the network to explicitly decorrelate its features; this will ensure that the first layer of the network sees data that follows a nice distribution. However even if we preprocess the input data, the activations at deeper layers of the network will likely no longer be decorrelated and will no longer have zero mean or unit variance since they are output from earlier layers in the network. Even worse, during the training process the distribution of features at each layer of the network will shift as the weights of each layer are updated.\n","\n","The authors of [1] hypothesize that the shifting distribution of features inside deep neural networks may make training deep networks more difficult. To overcome this problem, [1] proposes to insert batch normalization layers into the network. At training time, a batch normalization layer uses a minibatch of data to estimate the mean and standard deviation of each feature. These estimated means and standard deviations are then used to center and normalize the features of the minibatch. A running average of these means and standard deviations is kept during training, and at test time these running averages are used to center and normalize features.\n","\n","It is possible that this normalization strategy could reduce the representational power of the network, since it may sometimes be optimal for certain layers to have features that are not zero-mean or unit variance. To this end, the batch normalization layer includes learnable shift and scale parameters for each feature dimension.\n","\n","[1] Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy, \"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing\n","Internal Covariate Shift\", ICML 2015."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_p0R4iXxSUKj"},"source":["### Before We Start\n","\n","It is important that we take a look at the Mathematical formula behind Batch Norm.

Let's summarize the mathematics here: In the left column, we are given the input data, which consists (as always) of $N$ samples of dimension $D$. Furthermore, we need the learnable shift and scale parameters which we call $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$. The intermediates are describing the mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma$ that we need to compute from the input data and then $\\hat{x}$ which is the normalized input data. The output is given by $y$ which is the combination of the normalized data with the learnable parameters. \n","\n","The right column contains the mathematical formulations and can be summarized as follows:\n","1. For the given input x, we calculate the mean $\\mu$ across all input samples.\n","2. Based on the mean $\\mu$, we compute the variances $\\sigma$ of each value in the sample.\n","3. We then normalize the input data based on the computed mean and variance.\n","4. Finally, we combine the normalized data with the learnable parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$.\n","\n","Please remember that Batch Normalization behaves differently at training and test time.
